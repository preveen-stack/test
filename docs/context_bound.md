Context bounds is a language feature in Scala that simplifies the syntax for working with type classes. A context bound is a shorthand syntax for specifying a type parameter that requires a type class instance to be available in scope.

The syntax for a context bound is `A: B`, where `A` is the type parameter and `B` is the type class. This syntax is equivalent to passing an implicit parameter of type `B[A]` to a method or class.

For example, consider the following code that defines a generic `sum` method that can sum a list of any type `A` that has a `Numeric` type class instance:

```
def sum[A](list: List[A])(implicit numeric: Numeric[A]): A =
  list.foldLeft(numeric.zero)(numeric.plus)
```

This code uses an implicit parameter to access the `Numeric` type class instance for type `A`. With context bounds, this code can be simplified as follows:

```
def sum[A: Numeric](list: List[A]): A =
  list.foldLeft(Numeric[A].zero)(Numeric[A].plus)
```

In this code, the context bound `Numeric[A]` specifies that type `A` must have a `Numeric` type class instance available in scope. The `sum` method can now access the `Numeric` instance for type `A` without needing to explicitly pass an implicit parameter.

Context bounds are a powerful feature in Scala that allow developers to write generic code that can be used with any type that has a type class instance available in scope. They simplify the syntax and make code more concise and readable.
