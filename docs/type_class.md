In functional programming, a type class is a type system construct that defines a set of operations or behavior that can be applied to a given set of types, without having to modify the types themselves. It is a way to achieve polymorphism without inheritance or subtyping.

A type class defines a set of functions, called methods, that can be applied to one or more types that belong to the type class. These methods are typically implemented outside of the types they operate on, and they are passed to the type's instances as arguments. Type classes are a powerful way to achieve abstraction and modularity in functional programming, as they allow developers to define generic functions that can operate on any type that belongs to a specific type class.

Here's an example of a type class in Scala using the Cats library:

```
import cats.Monoid

def combineAll[A: Monoid](as: List[A]): A =
  as.foldLeft(Monoid[A].empty)(_ |+| _)
```

In this example, the `Monoid` type class is defined, which represents types that have a binary operation that is associative and has an identity element. The `combineAll` function takes a list of elements of any type `A` that belongs to the `Monoid` type class, and it returns the result of combining all the elements using the `|+|` operation of the `Monoid` instance for `A`.

This allows us to write generic code that can work with any type that belongs to the `Monoid` type class, without having to specify the concrete type. For example, we can use `combineAll` with a list of integers, strings, or any other type that has a `Monoid` instance defined for it.
